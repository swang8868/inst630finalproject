This is a project made with Three.js and Javascript. The data used is from https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohansss/data-of-1010-pokemons. It displays the average statistic values of each Type of Pokemon in a bar chart, and has landmark ARIA labeling that works for every screen reader except Dolphin screen reader and Talkback on Android, which do not appear to support the landmark aria role of role="region". There is also ARIA labeling for a live region to provide live status updates when a type button is used to change the current type, but this is not strictly necessary for functionality.
